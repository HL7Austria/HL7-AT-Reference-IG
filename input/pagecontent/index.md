This Implementation Guide (IG) serves as a reference for all FHIR IGs developed within the Austrian healthcare domain.

To support consistency and clarity, three distinct categories of IGs have been defined: Model IGs, Specification IGs, and Content IGs. Each category follows its own set of guidelines, which are outlined on their respective reference pages.

Before creating your own IG, please determine which category best fits your use case and structure your guide accordingly. An overview of the categories is provided below:
