### Naming conventions

In general the HL7 [FHIR naming conventions](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Guide_to_Designing_Resources###Naming_Rules_.26_Guidelines) apply. Essentially these conventions ask for **consistency** and **precision** (i.e. minimizing ambiguity, while ensuring the meaning is easily understood) when naming fields, resources or operations.

Most of these guidelines are suggestions, except the following rules that *must* be followed:
-  be U.S. English (spelled correctly!)
-  be expressed as a noun, with a preceding adjective where necessary to clarify the semantics and to make unique
-  not make use of trade-marked terms
-  case style must be followed:
   - resources must be lower case - ex. `at-core-patient`, patient resource is all lower case
   - elements must be lowerCamelCase - ex. `at-core-ext-address-additionalInformation`, the element address.additionalInformation is lowerCamelCase
   - operations must be lower case - e. `at-core-exampleoperation` example operation is all lower case

#### Profile Naming conventions

The **StructureDefintion Id** of a profile follows a prefix pattern, meaning that a name from left to right goes from specific to generic. It uses UpperCamelCase.

**ProfileName** = [*Realm*-], *Use-*, *ParentProfile*

**Realm** = Is this profile supposed to be used in a realm? Then use the **countryCode**[^ISO3166-3]

**Use** = What is this profile used for? **lower case**

**ParentProfile** =  Which profile does this profile extend from? **lower case**

[^ISO3166-3]: country codes are [ISO 3166-3](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) in the Alpha-2 code format, all lowercase.

Example: Patient used in Austria, for ELGA.
```
Realm = Austria -> at- (country code)
Use = HL7 Austria FHIR Core -> core-
ParentProfile = Patient -> patient
at-core-patient
```

Example: Immunization information for ELGA
```
Realm = Austria -> at-
Use = ELGA -> elga-
ParentProfile = Immunization -> immunization
at-elga-immunization
```

#### Extension Naming conventions

The **StructureDefintion Id** of an extension follows a suffix pattern, meaning that a name from left to right goes from generic to specific.

**ExtensionName** = [*Realm*-], *Use-*, *ext-* *ProfileItIsFor-*, *FieldItAdds*

**Realm** = Is this profile supposed to be used in a realm? Then use the **countryCode**[^ISO3166-3]

**Use** = What is this profile used for? **lower case**

**ext-** = indication that this is an Extension **lower case**

**ProfileItIsFor** = Either Base Profile or **Profile** previously defined (optional if extension can occur anywhere -> Ex. NullFlavor), without the Realm. **lower case**

**FieldItAdds** = **unique naming** for field **lowerCamelCase**

Example: Religions for a patient registered in Austria 
```
Realm = Austria -> at-
Use = HL7 Austria FHIR Core -> core-
Profile = Patient -> patient-
FieldItAdds = Religion -> religion
at-core-ext-patient-religion
```

Example: Extra field in Address
```
Realm = Austria -> at-
Use = HL7 Austria FHIR Core -> core-
Profile = Address -> address
FieldItAdds = Additional Information -> additionalInformation
at-core-ext-address-additionalInformation
```
